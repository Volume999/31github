# Worklog

## Day 1

First day log: Create repo, put license on it, create worklog file (just to keep up with the 31 days challenge)

## Day 2

Hello world, arithmetics, strings, variables

## Day 3

The guide is very basic and kind of boring so I went my own way.

## Day 3 - Day 15

I was doing the Alfred Extension - Password Generator

## Day 16 - Day 23

I was doing Advent of Code
